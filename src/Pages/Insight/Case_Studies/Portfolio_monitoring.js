    <Typography variant='h4' className='blue'>Summary  </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>Our client, a large private equity firm was spending an inordinate amount of time while analyzing the performance of their investment portfolio. The operations team was tasked to gather financial data from their portfolio companies spread globally and generate insights for the management team. The primary challenge was that these portfolio companies would send their financial data in varied formats and file types. The team also had to generate peer analysis for these companies. The operations team used to create individual excel sheets for each company and then convert that data into charts to create presentations for analysis.  </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>Decimal Point Analytics created a data template that could be used by any portfolio company and created a central data repository. The client could now generate comparative analysis by using the data from this repository. We also added a presentation layer for easy interaction with the underlying data. </Typography>

<Box className='whitebx' mt={1}>
    <Typography variant='h4' className='blue'>Data Collection Challenge - Multiple Data Formats and Filetypes  </Typography>
    
    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>The data gathering process from individual companies was time-consuming. Every company had a different format for the financial statements that made it difficult to compile the data into one place. The data collected was stored in multiple excel files and this did not allow the financial comparison of these companies. The data gathering process was also very time-consuming and resource-heavy, requiring a lot of man-hours to be utilized on segregation and compilation of the data. Individual dashboards for all the companies were developed in excel, which limited the scope of cross-portfolio analytics. The data collection and input process were done manually, and the analysis was exclusive for single companies. Peer analysis from the existing structure was not possible as the structure limited data insertion.</Typography>

    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>The challenge faced by the firm was to reduce the time consumed for data collection and structuring all the data in a standard format to draw out analysis between companies. They also required interactive dashboards for a better analysis of the data and quicker update times.  </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>
    Decimal Point Analytics provided them with a data template that can be used for all the companies together. This allowed to compile the entire data in one place and made it possible to draw out a comparative analysis between companies. Multiple templates for individual companies were provided for quick data insertion and less update time. We created ETL processes that allowed quicker data updates from the templates to the data repository where all the data is stored. Automated data validations were established for ensuring data accuracy of the data that was updated. The new data architecture allowed us to ingest external data to generate comparative peer analysis dashboards. 
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>
    The interactive dashboards were built from the repository that allowed them to quickly slice and dice the data based on their requirements and provided a deeper analysis of their investments. Furthermore, single source of data, quick data updates, interactive analytical dashboards, and peer analysis were all achieved.

    <Typography variant='h6' className='black jst'>
    The updated data architecture helped our client in collating all the data in a central repository. The standardized data templates, along with this repository and automation tools, helped in reducing the monthly update time from days to hours. Automation of the data update process and automated validations helped virtually eliminating errors. The interactive dashboards also helped them to slice and dice the data better, and to quickly do custom analysis. Analysis on a portfolio level was done by the newer data structure, which was not possible before as they had to go through multiple excel files to gather data and built the required file. Multiple dashboards including individual companies, specialized peer analysis dashboards, and portfolio dashboards were delivered as part of the project.
